# A snail fell into a bucket and wanted to crawl out. 
# Assuming we already know the snail can climb 5cm per 
# minute, the snail can crawl for 30 minutes continuously
#  and then needs to rest for 10 minutes. When it is resting it will slide down 30cm.

# How many minutes will it take for the snail to crawl 
# out from different depths? Create a function that takes 
# the bucket depth (the unit is cm) as an argument and 
# returns the time in minutes.

# if depth = 270
# the snail crawling process
# process: (150 - 30) +  150
# minutes: (30+10) + 150 / 5
# it will take 70 minutes
# the last 150cm, the snail doesn't need a rest
